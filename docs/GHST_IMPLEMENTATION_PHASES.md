# Phased Implementation Plan for the GHST Multi-Agent LLM System

## Current Syntax Fix Phase
In this phase, we focus on identifying and correcting syntax errors in the existing codebase. This ensures that the system runs smoothly and prepares the foundation for further enhancements.

## Ghost Manager Refactor
This phase involves restructuring the Ghost Manager component to improve code readability and maintainability. Refactoring aims to enhance performance and make future developments easier.

## Plugin System Enhancement
We aim to enhance the plugin system by allowing for greater flexibility and functionality. This includes integrating new plugins that can extend the capabilities of the GHST system.

## Error Handling Improvements
Improving error handling is crucial for system stability. This phase focuses on identifying common failure points and implementing robust error handling mechanisms to ensure that the system can recover gracefully from issues.

## Testing Strategy
A comprehensive testing strategy will be developed to ensure the reliability and performance of the GHST system. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing.

## Documentation Phases
Finally, thorough documentation will be created to describe the system architecture, implementation details, and usage instructions for end-users and developers.
